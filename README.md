# WS2812
WS2812 LED Light Strip Controller for MicroPython (still under construction). "Anything is possible if you just believe..."

Through messing around with my new Raspberry Pi Pico, I've been testing out some things with my LED Light Strips. 

Hopefully the work I put in tonight while half watching Ted Lasso with my family will help you out with whatever project you're doing! It's been tested on a relatively small strip, but I will be testing a bigger one once it comes in the mail as I have some memory concerns! So yeah, be forewarned, this is still under construction, but hopefully it'll be working great soon!
